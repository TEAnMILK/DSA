Phonebook Application Documentation
Overview
The Phonebook Application is a simple console-based application that allows users to manage a list of contacts. The application provides features to insert, search, display, delete, update, and sort contacts.

DATA STRUCTURE
The application uses a Contact structure to represent individual contacts. The Contact structure has two fields:
name: a string representing the contact's name
phoneNumber: a string representing the contact's phone number
The application also uses a List of Contacts to store all contacts.
